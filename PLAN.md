# Plan

- [x] Establish a pinned Nix build, test, and run environment. Completed 2026-07-09 20:44 EDT.
  Verified the sandboxed flake package runs all existing Meson tests.
- [x] Add top-level `build`, `test`, and `bm` commands and record benchmark results. Completed 2026-07-09 21:01 EDT.
  The benchmark uses Release Nix output, records a baseline, and requires a rerun to accept a change larger than 20%.
- [x] Define and test CLI selection, option precedence, and bounded-result rendering. Completed 2026-07-09 20:49 EDT.
  The pure selector gives later `--gui`/`--cli` flags precedence over `FSEARCH_UI`; limit resolution has default, environment, argument, and unlimited coverage.
- [x] Implement the CLI adapter as isolated source modules over the existing database API. Completed 2026-07-09 20:56 EDT.
  CLI mode owns load/search sequencing and bounded path output in `fsearch_cli.c`; the GTK application only dispatches and strips selector flags.
- [x] Add integration coverage for help, about, and environment precedence. Completed 2026-07-09 21:01 EDT.
  Remaining query-result fixture coverage belongs with a future database-fixture harness rather than real user index data.
- [ ] Run the full suite, benchmark suite, inspect the final tree, and commit each green unit.
